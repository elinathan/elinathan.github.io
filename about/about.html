                <p>Hi! I'm a graphic designer and photographer from Princeton, NJ, currently studying at UPenn. I specialize in designing and developing visual identities, brand guidelines, and publications.</p>
                <p>I’m currently on the creative team in Muse, the biggest marketing club at the Wharton School and UPenn developing B2B
                brand guidelines for rePurpose. I also work on the design team at Penn Appétit, a student-run food magazine.</p>
                <p>In 2018, after the tragic school shooting that February, I was asked to create graphics for the March for Our Lives in
                Parkland, Florida. The designs I created were utilized and seen extensively, including on national television. In
                recognition of my work, JP Morgan Chase subsequently invited me to their global headquarters in New York City, where I
                met with and was inspired by many top artists working in their creative team.</p>
                <p>My work has been exhibited in the Montclair Art Museum and The Arts Council of Princeton. It has also been seen on many
                national news networks including CNN, MSNBC, and HLN.</p>
